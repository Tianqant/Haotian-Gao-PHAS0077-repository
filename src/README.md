### Quick Start Guide

Make sure you have the data folder `gnn_data` in the main directory inside the folder named `raw` (for example, the file path is `/raw/gnn_data/*.csv`).

You can then run the command:

`python main.py -c config/gnn/gnn.json` 

to run the code with the gnn described in this config file.
